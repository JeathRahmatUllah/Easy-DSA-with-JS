# **Understanding Hash Tables: A Beginner's Guide**

### **1. Teaching "Hash Tables" to a Beginner**

#### **What is a Hash Table?**
- A **hash table** is like a magical box where you can store and find things quickly.
- It uses a **key** (like a name) to find a **value** (like a phone number).
- The key is turned into a **magic number** (called a **hash**) using a special formula. This number tells the box where to store the value.

#### **Example:**
Imagine a phone book:
- **Key**: Name (e.g., "Alice").
- **Value**: Phone number (e.g., "123-456-7890").
- The hash table uses a magic formula to find where "Alice" is stored and quickly retrieves her phone number.

### **2. Good Examples of Hash Tables**

#### **Example 1: Phone Book**
- **Keys**: Names of people.
- **Values**: Their phone numbers.
- **Use Case**: Quickly find someone’s phone number by their name.

#### **Example 2: Dictionary**
- **Keys**: Words.
- **Values**: Definitions.
- **Use Case**: Quickly look up the meaning of a word.

#### **Example 3: Student Grades**
- **Keys**: Student IDs.
- **Values**: Grades.
- **Use Case**: Quickly find a student’s grade by their ID.

### **3. Leetcode-Type Problems**

#### **Problem 1: Easy (Two Sum)**
- **Task**: Given an array of numbers and a target, find two numbers that add up to the target.
- **Example**:
  - Input: `nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]`, `target = 9`
  - Output: `[0, 1]` (because `2 + 7 = 9`)

#### **Problem 2: Medium (First Unique Character in a String)**
- **Task**: Find the first non-repeating character in a string.
- **Example**:
  - Input: `"leetcode"`
  - Output: `0` (because `'l'` is the first unique character)

### **4. Pseudo Code Solutions**

#### **Problem 1: Two Sum**
```
1. Create an empty hash table.
2. Loop through the array:
   - For each number, calculate its complement (target - number).
   - If the complement exists in the hash table, return the indices.
   - Otherwise, store the number and its index in the hash table.
```

#### **Problem 2: First Unique Character in a String**
```
1. Create a hash table to store the frequency of each character.
2. Loop through the string to count the frequency of each character.
3. Loop through the string again to find the first character with a frequency of 1.
4. Return the index of that character.
```

### **5. Real Code in JavaScript**

#### **Problem 1: Two Sum**
```javascript
// Function to solve the Two Sum problem
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  let hashTable = {}; // Create an empty hash table

  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) { // Loop through the array
    let complement = target - nums[i]; // Calculate the complement
    if (complement in hashTable) { // Check if the complement exists in the hash table
      return [hashTable[complement], i]; // Return the indices
    }
    hashTable[nums[i]] = i; // Store the number and its index in the hash table
  }

  return []; // Return an empty array if no solution is found
}

// Test the function
let nums = [2, 7, 11, 15];
let target = 9;
console.log(twoSum(nums, target)); // Output: [0, 1]
```

#### **Problem 2: First Unique Character in a String**
```javascript
// Function to find the first unique character in a string
function firstUniqueChar(s) {
  let hashTable = {}; // Create an empty hash table

  // Count the frequency of each character
  for (let char of s) {
    if (char in hashTable) {
      hashTable[char]++;
    } else {
      hashTable[char] = 1;
    }
  }

  // Find the first character with a frequency of 1
  for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
    if (hashTable[s[i]] === 1) {
      return i; // Return the index of the first unique character
    }
  }

  return -1; // Return -1 if no unique character is found
}

// Test the function
let s = "leetcode";
console.log(firstUniqueChar(s)); // Output: 0
```

### **Explanation **

#### **Problem 1: Two Sum**
- Imagine you have a list of numbers and a target number.
- You use a magical box (hash table) to remember the numbers you’ve seen and where they are.
- For each number, you check if the number you need to reach the target is already in the box.
- If it is, you’ve found the two numbers!

#### **Problem 2: First Unique Character in a String**
- Imagine you have a word, and you want to find the first letter that doesn’t repeat.
- You use a magical box (hash table) to count how many times each letter appears.
- Then, you look through the word to find the first letter that only appears once.

### **Key Takeaways**
- A **hash table** is like a magical box that helps you store and find things quickly.
- It uses **keys** to find **values** using a special formula (hash function).
- Hash tables are used in real-life scenarios like phone books, dictionaries, and student records.
