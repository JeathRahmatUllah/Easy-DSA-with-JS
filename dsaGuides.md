### 🎨 Data Structures & Algorithms: An Artistic Journey 🌟

#### 🗃️ Data Structures

1. **🔢 Array**
   - **Description:** A collection of elements identified by index or key, like a row of lockers where each locker holds a number or item.

2. **🔗 Linked List**
   - **Description:** A sequence of elements, where each element points to the next one, like a treasure hunt where each clue leads to the next.
   - **Variations:** 
     - 🔄 Singly Linked List: Each node points to the next.
     - 🔁 Doubly Linked List: Each node points to both the next and previous nodes.
     - 🔄🔁 Circular Linked List: The last node points back to the first, forming a circle.

3. **📚 Stack**
   - **Description:** A collection of elements that follows Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, like a stack of plates where you can only take the top one.
   
4. **🚶‍♂️ Queue**
   - **Description:** A collection of elements that follows First In, First Out (FIFO) principle, like a line of people waiting for a ride.
   - **Variations:**
     - 🆕 Simple Queue: Basic FIFO queue.
     - 🔄 Circular Queue: The end connects back to the beginning.
     - 🎖️ Priority Queue: Elements are dequeued based on priority.
     - ↔️ Deque: Double-ended queue where elements can be added or removed from both ends.

5. **🔍 Hash Table**
   - **Description:** A data structure that maps keys to values for efficient lookup, like a magical dictionary where you can find the meaning instantly.

6. **🌳 Tree**
   - **Description:** A hierarchical data structure with a root node and child nodes forming a parent-child relationship, like a family tree.
   - **Variations:**
     - 🌿 Binary Tree: Each node has at most two children.
     - 🔍 Binary Search Tree: A binary tree with sorted nodes.
     - 📈 AVL Tree: A self-balancing binary search tree.
     - ⚫🔴 Red-Black Tree: Another type of self-balancing binary search tree.
     - 📚 B-Tree: A balanced tree for efficient disk storage.
     - 🗑️ Heap: A special tree-based structure used for priority queues.

7. **🌐 Graph**
   - **Description:** A collection of nodes and edges where nodes may be connected by edges, like a social network where people are nodes and friendships are edges.
   - **Variations:**
     - ➡️ Directed Graph: Edges have directions.
     - 🔄 Undirected Graph: Edges have no directions.
     - ⚖️ Weighted Graph: Edges have weights.
     - ⚖️ Unweighted Graph: Edges have no weights.

#### 🔍 Algorithms

1. **🔄 Sorting Algorithms**
   - **Description:** Algorithms to arrange elements in a specific order (ascending or descending), like organizing books on a shelf.
   - **Variations:**
     - 🧼 Bubble Sort: Repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
     - 🔍 Selection Sort: Selecting the smallest element and moving it to the front.
     - 📝 Insertion Sort: Building the sorted array one element at a time.
     - ⚔️ Merge Sort: Dividing the array into halves, sorting and merging them.
     - ⚡ Quick Sort: Partitioning the array around a pivot and sorting the partitions.
     - 🗑️ Heap Sort: Using a heap structure to sort elements.
     - 🗂️ Radix Sort: Sorting numbers by their individual digits.

2. **🔍 Searching Algorithms**
   - **Description:** Algorithms to find the position of a target value within a data structure, like finding a book in a library.
   - **Variations:**
     - 🔍 Linear Search: Checking every element until the target is found.
     - 🔍 Binary Search: Dividing the sorted array and eliminating half each time.

3. **🌳 Traversal Algorithms**
   - **Description:** Algorithms to visit all the nodes or elements in a data structure, like exploring all the rooms in a house.
   - **Variations:**
     - 🌳 Trees: Inorder, Preorder, Postorder.
     - 🌐 Graphs: Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS).

4. **💡 Dynamic Programming**
   - **Description:** A method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and storing the results, like solving a puzzle by solving smaller pieces first.

5. **💰 Greedy Algorithms**
   - **Description:** Algorithms that make the locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding the global optimum, like grabbing the biggest piece of candy each time.

6. **📏 Divide and Conquer**
   - **Description:** Algorithms that divide the problem into smaller subproblems, solve each subproblem recursively, and combine their solutions, like cutting a cake into pieces to serve everyone.

7. **🔄 Backtracking**
   - **Description:** Algorithms that try to build a solution incrementally and backtrack as soon as they determine that a partial solution cannot lead to a complete solution, like solving a maze by trying different paths.

8. **🔍 Graph Algorithms**
   - **Description:** Algorithms specific to graph data structures, like finding the shortest path in a city.
   - **Variations:**
     - 🛣️ Dijkstra's Algorithm: Finding the shortest path between nodes.
     - 🛤️ Bellman-Ford Algorithm: Finding shortest paths in a graph with negative weights.
     - 📏 Floyd-Warshall Algorithm: Finding shortest paths between all pairs of nodes.
     - 🏰 Prim's Algorithm: Finding the minimum spanning tree.
     - 🏰 Kruskal's Algorithm: Another way to find the minimum spanning tree.
